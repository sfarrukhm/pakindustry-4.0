# Predictive Maintenance: Turbofan Engine RUL Prediction
Deep learning-based remaining useful life prediction for jet engines using NASA C-MAPSS dataset

## Executive Summary

This project implements an end-to-end predictive maintenance solution for jet engines using deep learning techniques. Built on NASA's Commercial Modular Aero-Propulsion System Simulation (C-MAPSS) turbofan engine degradation dataset, the system predicts Remaining Useful Life (RUL) by analyzing multivariate sensor time series data. The solution employs LSTM neural networks trained on sequences of 21 sensor measurements to forecast engine failure cycles, enabling proactive maintenance scheduling and reducing unplanned downtime. The modular architecture supports easy experimentation with different model configurations and datasets.

## Problem Statement & Business Value

**Challenge:** Unplanned aircraft engine failures can result in:

**Solution:** Predictive maintenance using sensor data analysis to:
- Predict engine failure 50-100 cycles in advance
- Schedule maintenance during planned downtime

## Performance Metrics & Results

### Current Model Performance

**Validation Set Results:**
- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error):** 11.24 cycles
- **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error):** 16.63 cycles  
- **NASA Scoring Function:** 11,132.30

**Split Test Set Results:**
- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error):** 12.26 cycles
- **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error):** 18.40 cycles
- **NASA Scoring Function:** 12,913.99

**NASA Official Test Set Results:**
- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error):** 13.54 cycles
- **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error):** 19.05 cycles
- **NASA Scoring Function:** 681.43

### Performance Context
The model demonstrates strong predictive accuracy with MAE values consistently below 14 cycles across all evaluation sets. The RMSE values (16-19 cycles) indicate relatively few large prediction errors. Most notably, the NASA Official Test Set achieves an exceptional NASA Score of 681.43, significantly outperforming the validation and split test results. This suggests the model generalizes well to the standardized evaluation benchmark and provides safety-appropriate conservative predictions for real-world deployment.
