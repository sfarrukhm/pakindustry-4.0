# PakIndustry 4.0 – UraanAI Techathon 2025

## 🚀 Overview

This repository contains our submission for the **UraanAI Techathon 2025** (Manufacturing Industry track).  
We tackle all three core challenges:

1. **Defect Detection (Computer Vision)** – Detect manufacturing defects in images using YOLOv8 / EfficientNet / anomaly detection.
2. **Predictive Maintenance (IoT / Time Series)** – Predict equipment failures and Remaining Useful Life (RUL) from sensor data.
3. **Supply Chain Forecasting (AI Forecasting)** – Forecast product demand and optimize supply chains.

Our goal is to **enable Industry 4.0 solutions in Pakistan** by reducing defects, avoiding downtime, and improving supply chain efficiency.

## 🧪 Reproducibility

### Environment Reproducibility
```bash
# Exact environment recreation
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Alternative with conda
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate defect-detection
```

### Seed Configuration
- **Global Seed**: 42 (set in config.yaml)
- **PyTorch Seed**: Deterministic operations enabled
- **NumPy Seed**: Fixed for data preprocessing
- **Train/Val/Test Split**: Reproducible with stratification

### Model Checkpointing
- **Best Model**: Saved based on validation accuracy
- **Early Stopping**: Prevents overfitting with patience=10
- **Version Control**: All experiments tracked with timestamps
