# PakIndustry 4.0 â€“ UraanAI Techathon 2025

## ðŸš€ Overview

This repository contains our submission for the **UraanAI Techathon 2025** (Manufacturing Industry track).  
We tackle all three core challenges:

1. **Defect Detection (Computer Vision)** â€“ Detect manufacturing defects in images using YOLOv8 / EfficientNet / anomaly detection.
2. **Predictive Maintenance (IoT / Time Series)** â€“ Predict equipment failures and Remaining Useful Life (RUL) from sensor data.
3. **Supply Chain Forecasting (AI Forecasting)** â€“ Forecast product demand and optimize supply chains.

Our goal is to **enable Industry 4.0 solutions in Pakistan** by reducing defects, avoiding downtime, and improving supply chain efficiency.
